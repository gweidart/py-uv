## Core Errors

### uv-error (Base Error)
- **Code:** `uv-error`
- **Description:**  
  This is the base error class for the UV API. It represents generic or unspecified errors that occur within the system.
- **Possible Causes:**  
  - An internal error that does not fall under any specific category.
- **Hints:**  
  - Check internal logs and diagnostic details for more context.
- **Notes:**

### dependency-conflict
- **Code:** `dependency-conflict`
- **Description:**  
  Occurs when there is a conflict among dependency version requirements during package installation.
- **Possible Causes:**  
  - Multiple packages require incompatible versions of the same dependency.
- **Hints:**  
  - Specify explicit version constraints in your configuration.
  - Consider isolating dependencies by using a separate virtual environment.
- **Notes:**  
  - Use the command `uv list --tree` to inspect dependency relationships and identify conflicting packages.

### network-error

- **Description:**  
  Triggered when a network-related issue occurs during an operation.
- **Possible Causes:**  
  - Network connectivity problems.
